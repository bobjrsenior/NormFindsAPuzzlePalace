Norm was just a normal guy. Walking around and standing in the middle of the woods like anyone else. After coming back from a good stand, he thought he heard a faint call of some sort. With Norm's characteristic smile, he went to find where the source was and he found something amazing...

	It was a Puzzle Palace!
	As a Normal guy, Norm decided to enter the puzzle palace and enjoy the wondrous puzzles that awaited him.



Norm leaves the Puzzle Palace with his mortal flesh melted away and feeling as normal as can be. In Norm's hand is a pick from the Puzzle Palace. With it, Norm makes a normal mask of flesh and gold. Norm then travels around to spread the Puzzle Palace's wonderful knowledge to others.

Puzzle Levels:

Lose a life:
Norm's mind falters. A normal person like Norm should be able to handle a puzzle like this. Failing a puzzle just doesn't make sense. Norm didn't fail the puzzle, there's just no way. Norm sets his mind and begins the next puzzle in the Palace.

When you Lose fully:
Norm's smile twitched. As a normal person, Norm is great at solving puzzles. How could he possibly lose one??? It makes no sense! Norm's mind starts getting lost on this question. This question disturbed Norm and takes up his thoughts as faint memories of previous failures start taking hold. As the thoughts of failure take up his normal mind, a faint calling slowly dissapears from his mind and Norm finds himself in front of the palace left to contemplate his failure.
